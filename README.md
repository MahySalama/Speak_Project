Requirements
The Hero Education and Relationship Organization (HERO) is so impressed with the work we did on the Superhero Sightings Data Layer project that they have awarded us a contract to build a Spring Boot web application.

The system has the following requirements:

It must have a screen(s) to create, view, edit, and delete superheroes/supervillains in the system.
It must have a screen(s) to create, view, edit, and delete superpowers in the system.
It must have a screen(s) to create, view, edit, and delete locations in the system.
It must have a screen(s) to create, view, edit, and delete superhero/supervillain organizations in the system.
It must have a screen(s) to create, view, edit, and delete superhero/supervillain sighting (superhero/supervillain, location, and time) in the system.
It must have a home page that displays general information about the application, navigation to all the other pages, and a newsfeed of the latest 10 sightings in the database.
CHALLENGE 1: Allow users to upload a picture for each superhero/supervillain and then display the picture when the sighting(s) of that superhero/supervillain is displayed.
CHALLENGE 2: Incorporate Google Maps into the home/landing page and show the location of each of the sightings in the sightings news feed (this is a stretch goal - completely on your own. We have no material about incorporating Google maps into your application).
